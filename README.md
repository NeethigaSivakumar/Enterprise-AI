    Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
    Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm. The "forest" it builds, is an ensemble of decision trees, usually trained with the “bagging” method.The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning models increases the overall result.
    Random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
    Random forest is also a very handy algorithm because the default hyperparameters it uses often produce a good prediction result and has less variance.It overcomes the problem of overfitting by averaging or combining the results of different decision trees. 
    It works well for a large range of data items than a single decision tree does.
